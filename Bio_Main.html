    : Hey there. If you're here because you're interested in seeing some of my stuff n' junk, no worries. I :
    | know the hyperlink says "personal" bio, but it's really not that personal if I decided to share it on |
    : on the Internet; so of course you're invited to look around for yourself. Go ahead and take a look at :
    | some of the things that make me "me." A little way below these paragraphs there is a list of links to |
    : selected projects of mine - there you will find ASCII art, short stories, poems, and in-real-life     :
    | pictures (converted in ASCII form, of course).                                                        |
    :                                                                                                       :
    | However, this autobiography doesn't just aim a spotlight on only myself and my personal works. It     |
    : would be awfully short if that were so. Here you will also find long lists containing noteworthy      :
    | books, quotes, other people's ASCII art, and the etcetera; I also write about some of the people and  |
    : projects that inspired me to venture out, to create and make my own.                                  :
    |                                                                                                       |
    : That's always the second part of a biography. The documentation of a person, whoever they may be, is  : 
    | not fulfilled until descriptions of inspirational sources are written; basically, the parts that      |
    : describes what inspired that said person to do great and magnificent things - things that were        :
    | amazing to behold, things that called for its creator to be rightfully recognized. And if someone     |
    : was recognized enough to be written about, than you know for a fact that there is a background of     :
    | inspiration that also rightfully needs to be recognized alongside with this great person. It gives    |
    : the whole biography - or shall I say, story - a supportive context which absolutely fulfills the need :
    | for descriptive details that are necessary for any biography.                                         |
    :                                                                                                       :
    | Anyway, I hope you enjoy my little Internet hideout. :^D Maybe I'll see ya' later on the forums! O/   |
